EVENTDRIVEN
A website for buying tickets to events.

Extra requirements:

Modal booking: The booking process is done through a modal popup process that provides a much better user experience and allows users to see all the different ticket type prices and view a more extensive description without leaving the page.

Mobile-friendly: The entire application is mobile-friendly. A large part of users on the world wide web are mobile users, so it is essential to accommodate them as they are a considerable market share. 

Search bar: The application has a great search bar on the home, entertainers, and search page. The search bar allows users to choose a category, date range and search for an event, entertainer, location, city, and country. After the search, the user will be directed to a search page where he can view the events matching his search and entertainers. We found out through user testing that a search bar is often a user's first instinct to find what they are looking for there, for the bar is very visible and should drastically improve the user experience. 

Dashboard for logged-in users: The dashboard allows logged-in users to view their tickets and the ticket id. The dashboard also includes the user's favorite categories and entertainers, which was a base requirement, but below those fields, the user can view upcoming events that use his favorite entertainers and categories and display relevant events in order of the most compatible to the least compatible. Events that have nothing in common with users' favorites will not appear. 

Entertainers page: The user can view all the entertainers by using the nav bar and visiting the entertainer's page. There, he can view all the entertainers in the database and immediately see the entertainer's next event date and location on their cards. The user can then navigate to a specific entertainer to view a more detailed description and see all his upcoming events and navigate to them if he wants.

Event page bonus features: The entertainer's page includes some bonus features like a google map that shows the event's location. The map helps the user figure out where the event is located quickly. By clicking the directions button on the map, the user is directed to google maps, where he can quickly get directions from his current location to the event, improving the web application's user experience. The event also displays all the entertainers appearing in that event; if the entertainer's card is selected, the user will navigate to the entertainer's page. 

Creating new events: Admin/super users can create new events by navigating to the dashboard, which can be found in the navigation bar, and pressing the button in the top left corner which says create a new event. There, the user can fill in all the required fields and then be directed to a page where he can continue filling in the more relevant information and see what the event's card and the page will look like. 

Editing existing events: Admin/super users can edit existing events by navigating to that event-specific page and selecting the button in the right-hand upper corner. There the user can edit the categories, entertainers, ticket type price, and view how the event's card and the page will look like. 

Populating booking form automatically: When the user is signed in and has filled in his profile information, the booking process gets easier. The application will fill in fields for the user that match the information he previously provided in his profile.
